# Bubble Sort By CMake

> What's wrong with me?

It's surprised to know that CMake is a turing complete language. I decided to write some algorithms with CMake. And here it is.

## Complaint
I know it's not CMake's fault because it was not mean to it. But the way to pass parameters and return values really sucks.
And it's totally a horrible experience with calculating.
