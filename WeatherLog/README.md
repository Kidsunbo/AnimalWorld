# Weather Log
> This is just a small application which runs on my Raspberry Pi to log the weather. No more functionality, just for practicing for setup the coding enviroment and use the network.

### Dependency
This app requires some library which are listed below:
 
- libcur
- cpr
- nlohmann json

This app should be compiled with `C++17` and with `filesystem` supported.

### Summary
It's just a small application with about 100 lines of code. So, nothing worth being mentioned. Just store it here for further usage, if there is one.
